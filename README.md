# Image processing
*The first step of this project is to do image processing and discover all packages and functions to do that.(done)
*The second step is to implement a machine learning model.(In progress)

## Installation:
> Download the ipynb file and launch your jupyter notebook

## First results:
#### using some known packages and functions for image processing
